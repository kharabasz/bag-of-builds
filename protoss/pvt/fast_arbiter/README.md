# PvT Fast Arbitor (23 Nexus Expand)

```
NOTE: This build assumes the terran is playing towards a 3 base 200/200 2-1 push. See footnotes for scouting and adjustments.
8 pylon
10 gate
11/12 gas
13 cyber
probes on gas asap
15 pylon - block behind minerals to block scvs
@100% cyber - dragoon
@100% cyber - dragoon range
21 - dragoon
scout with first dragoon
cut dragoons and probes at 23
probe that comes out @23 builds Nexus
23 pylon 
probe that builds nexus/pylon scouts opposite of dragoon [1]
resume probes
dragoon should poke a bit past any bunkers to confirm cc
cc still being built - factory expand [2]
2nd dragoon should stay near ramp/choke so if there was a vulture it can't sneak into main
25 robo
resume dragoons
30 2x gateway
send 7 probes to natural
34 observatory
build pylons as needed
@100% observatory - observer
if terran still hasn't come out of his base take some goons to main as it could be a factory starport build (vulture drops)
44 2nd gas and citadel
first observer goes to scout terran base. [3]
stop goons at 7
take 3rd nexus
resume dragoons
57 stargate then templar archives then forge
reposition goons forward
~7:30-8:00 check if the terran is building a 3rd cc. [4]
Assuming 3rd cc add 2-3 gateways. Immediately after gates add arbital tribunal. 
Now you should be safe to take a 4th.
Research zealot legs
Make arbitor
~100 get 2nd stargate, get recall or stasis
If you pumped probes until 100 supply you should be saturated and can cut further probes.
Play safe, pull goons back, add 1 cannon per expo, go up to 12 gateways.
Pump out units - you want around 22-24 dragoons, 3-4 arbitors, and the rest in speed zealots. Max at ~12mins.
Spread out observers in the middle of the map
Prepare to take a 5th expansion.
When trading make sure you don't lose goons as it is faster to remax off pure zealot
Start getting templar and storm and make non-stop arbitors
Take additional expos when you can
When storming focus tanks, storm isn't effected by terran upgrades
```

__Footnotes__
```
[1] If terran does not have a cc then 2 factory is highly probable. Cut probes for a while and get 2 more gates for 3 total. You may need to build a battery at your natural and bring probes when fighting.
[2] If the terran's cc is already done than he went cc first. You can adjust your build by going 3rd off of 2 gate obs instead of 3 but must be prepared to add gates if the terran is planning a fast push off of 4-5 factories.
[3] What you should see here is 2 factories and a spinning armory. If you see 1 factory, look for a starport. If there is a starport continue the build and be weary of dropships however it may just be a 2-1 push from the terran. If terran is adding factories, cut probes, get 2-4 more gateways than the terran has factories, get zealot bombs, and mass units to defend the push. There will be one big push and if you crush it you win.
[4] You should see a 3rd cc by now. If you see a cc it is likely a 3base 200/200 2-1 move out. If you do not see a cc it is likely a 2base 170/200 2-1 move out. If it is 2base, do not take a forth, get zealot legs, 10+ gateways, and a second stargate for double arbitors. There will be one big push and if you crush it you can double expand to get ahead.
