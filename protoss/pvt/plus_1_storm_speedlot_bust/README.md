# crvt's 3 base Storm/+1 Attack/Speedlot bust

```
Start off with Light's opening or a variations on it, such as:
- 23 nex
- 3 gate obs
- 7 goons
- 2nd gas/3rd nex
And now it can be varied

If we want to hit at 10:30, we can go:
- citadel
- forge
- +1 attack
- 3 more goons
- archives/4th gate
- 4 templars
- 4-6 more gates depending on when you cut probes. 
At latest we cut probes at 9 min (should have ~65) for 8 gates. We can go 10 gates if we start cutting at 8 or 8:30 for a slightly stronger timing.
First 150 gas after 4 hts goes into legs, next 200 into storm, we order shuttle after we added gates and then we just make zealots.
By the time we push we'll have storm/legs/+1 finishing all at once, templars will be at some 130 energy so some time into the engagement they can get a 2nd storm off.
We order citadel before forge so that we can order templars earlier, they get more energy and we get more minerals for gates.

If we want to hit with less but at 9:30, we can go:
- forge first since we still want +1, so we order forge and +1 faster
- citadel on next 100 gas
- archives
We cut probes earlier for extra gates, but we order speed and storm before any templars.
After speed and storm we spend all minerals on zealots and all gas on templars, we get a shuttle as late as possible.
This will hit earlier, with less zealots and off of a worse economy, with 3 templars with one storm each.
This wants to hit before terran adds extra factories (after their 3rd base) and before those factories make vultures and lay too many mines as mines is what stops this. We can drag some, but not infinity.

A 9:30 version is what I would play against a 6fact +1 off of 2 base - except we'd be defending, not attacking. We'd be cutting probes to be just a little bit ahead in eco and we'd have many gates, and speedlot/storm incoming, so we'd just need to slow the push a bit until we can crush it.

We can transition into 2/1 and robo bay for shuttle speed after our bust, if we successfully busted the 3rd or at least erased lots of tanks and interrupted mining.
Generally I take a 4th and add a 2nd forge as I move out.
If we went for an 8min probe cut into a 9:30 bust, it probably makes more sense to resume probe production before we take a 4th.
Having storm and +1 adds a lot of flexibility.

On another note, the 3 base bust doesn't work if they go for a quick 3rd into tons of factories. 
If they don't spend gas on starport/facility but get more factories instead, they're going for a +1 or 1/1 max off of 3 base, basically doing the terran equivalent of gateway man. We can't bust their defensive position, then, but we can fight them in the open just fine, as they didn't go for +2 and we have storm/upgrades so we'll be fine.
Our observer should see what they're building/when they're adding factories, and if they rush them like this it is better to not cut probes until 9 min, get a 4th off of 6 gates, then 5th off of 10 gates, and we'll be maxed by the time they are and ready to defend / engage to trade well and delay their 4th.
They just get too many vultures and too many mines too fast to successfully bust them when they're all turtled up, and their reinforcements match ours in strength.
So it is better to outgrow them in eco, and then it is their problem that they maxed fast and need to make a move on the map without +2.
If they delay taking their 3rd, such as going for +1 6fac or 2-1 7fac, we can go for the 9:30 version, except instead of pushing we make an arc outside of their choke(vs 2-1, vs +1 we fight on our side of the map defensively) and fight as they try to move out, regardless if it is to attack us or to take a 3rd. We have banked energy and storm etc.
vs 2-1 7fac we can take a 4th just no need to make over 60 probes, we leave more supply for army.
We want to engage after they moved from their choke into the open, preferably before they have front mines and are all sieged, and as we come in from an arc.
It is fine to simply trade armies there, they built it up all game and our remax will be faster
