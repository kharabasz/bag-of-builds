# crvt's variation on +1/+1 opening off of 13nex 13 cannon

```
13 13
15 gate made by probe that made 13 cannon
16 pylon 16 gas
4 probe transfer, probes rallied to nat until core finishes
18 core
22 zealot
cutting 2nd zealot entirely
24 gas
stargate
+1/+1, ground first
pylon
citadel
36/42 sair (tight on gas but with 24 2nd gas on point makes it)
36/42 pylon(still on 1 zealot)
38/42 probe cut
40/42 zealot - we'll likely have to block with 2 zeal/probe vs speedlings
40/42 2nd gate(natural)
42/42 sair
42/42 speed
44/50 2 probes
46/50 zealot
46/50 pylon
48/50 2 probes, cut after
48/50 2nd cannon
50/50 3rd sair / cut sairs. 3rd sair started on a bit of a delay but should finish and get to cannon before scourge gets it. with this version we do not get cannon in main, assuming we save hydra den + evo with our sair. zerg can still get 5 muta but they'll be a bit late and zealots should win some time for us to start cannons in main/nat and resume sair production.
54/58 2 zealots
54/58 pylon
56/58 2 probes, cut
56/58 2 gates, archives
60/66 2 zealots, original 5 zealots move out. they should have speed crossing half the map, 2 zealot reinforce, 2nd cannon is done before we move out
62/66 2 probes
62/66 pylon, pylon
64/66 2 probes
66/66 2 probes
74/82 3 ht + dt, dt sneaks out to check on zerg drone vs hydra production 
76/82 2 probes, pylon x2, storm
76/82 2 gates
78/82 2 probes
88/90 4 zealots, +1 armor(can be a bit delayed to line up better with goon follow-up), pylon, 2 probes, pylon
90/98 2 probes
102/106 6 zealots / attack with 11 zealots 3 HT if zerg did not make 20+ hydras, otherwise wait a round, attack with 17 zealots, rally 6 more/get 2 more gates and robo/range
```

```
Order 6 zealots and rally the gates before moving out, HTs do walk even across a bit faster than zealots build and run. We want to give Z less time to react.

If you are attacking now, cut probes(about 52'ish probe saturation) and get robo -> range -> 2 more gates -> 6 goon, pylons accordingly. Follow-up +1 armor attack with 14 goon and obs at 10:30, 8 more goons rallied, after that probably getting zealot/HT, +2 weapons, templar energy, 3rd, and cannon in main/nat vs lurk drop.

Looks like Z can have about 5 mutas at 9 min if they get 15+ hydras and both upgrades and overlord speed, but HTs should already be in position to storm and trade. We can probably recover from there by skipping observatory/obs, replacing half a goon round with zealots and re-making a couple of HT and resuming sairs.
	
Consider delaying +1 armor for a faster robo, or just make sure to get robo asap after 6 zealots?

After that range -> 2 pylons -> 2 gates -> 6 goons -> observatory -> obs/8 goons -> move, first 6 goons secure 3rd location. Can't afford 9 gate and production at the same time.

2nd forge after 8 goons
