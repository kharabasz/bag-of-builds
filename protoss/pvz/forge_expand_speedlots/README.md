# crvt's variation on stargate-less speedlot opening off of 13nex 13 cannon

```
11-12 forge
- hotkey it for fast +1 later in case you need to micro scouting probe and don't want to change screen
13 nexus
13 cannon
15 gate, hotkey it as you place it as well
16 pylon
17 gas
zealot before core
22 core, may hotkey that as well to add citadel as soon as it finishes/track progress
24 2nd zealot
28 +1 ground weapons
delay on 3rd zealot for probes -> citadel on 100 gas/core complete
30 pylon (at natural!)
3rd zealot - delayed
32 citadel / hotkey it where forge was
34 3rd zealot
36 2nd gate - at natural if map allows to place it without taking cannon space; most maps do
38 pylon
40 4th zealot
42 speed (5:08-ish)
42 pylon. we want pylons to be able to add cannons to cover both mineral lines from all angles if needed later
44 2nd cannon at natural
48 2 zealots
48/50 pylon, probe cut
all at 48/50, after the pylon and in this order:
- 2nd gas, important
- 3rd gate/archives (can be same time, ~05:40)
50/50 2 probes
54/58 2 zealots(zealots #7/8)
- attack with 6 slow zealots, natural cannon should finish as you move out (~5:56)
- be ready to reinforce with zealots 7-8
54 pylon
- mine 2nd gas, important
56 pylon #2
4th gate when money is available, a bit before 3rd gate is done
~6:20 zealots 7-8 finish, hotkey them together with main group as you approach zerg base
~6:30 contact with the first Z base we targeted + speed and +1 finishes a bit after
this is the time when mutas would be about to hatch if they went for gas after or a bit before 3rd hatch(but not immediately after 2nd hatch)

regardless of mutas:
2ht

build will become hard to follow as zealots move out, so treat it more as a guideline/priority list and general overview of how we spend gas when we intentionally cut probes and what sort of timing/army we are looking for
```

__mutas at 6:30-7 min:__
```
cannons, like 3 per base, archon rushed from first 2 ht's, consider a battery, next gas into 2 hts. those hts also into archon if zerg made >5 mutas
add gates later when money is available, do not cut probes until 8 min
if possible try to scout later(aka around 8 min) with some zealots if zerg is making hydra or droning, prioritize hts/and storm or robo accordingly. can get hts anyway, but storm and robo timings can vary
the follow-up depends on what the zerg is doing
generally you want to push with some archon-zealot to preferably force things that aren't muta
and against that we decide if we want storm/hts (they're massing hydra) or goons (mass sunk) or goon/obs (lurkerss etc)
```

__no mutas and general build order priorities for a follow up push:__
```
1 zealot from 3rd gate
then 1 ht / 3 more zealots next round
pylon -> storm on 200 gas(~6:45)
next 100 gas into +1 armor
next 200 gas into robo, next 150 into goon range
while you're getting all that tech, 2 rounds of 4 zealots / pylon as needed
    if you have the speed to do so, use these zealots to clear ground scouts nearby you and then roam next to zerg to make sure he made enough hydra or sunkens or whatever
at 7:50 to 8 min+ stop probe production, we should be about saturated

after ordering the two zealot rounds from 4 gates and robo/range, brief break in unit production, spend money into gateways going up to 8 instead, we also get influx of minerals from probe cut at this point
4 more gates
observatory
4 goons
8goons/(can delay obs until after goons are started, as we're lacking gas a bit)
if you have the speed to do so, after ordering 8 goons, escort a probe to a 3rd base and order nexus on 400 minerals there
```
