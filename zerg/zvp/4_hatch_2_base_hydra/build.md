**__ZvP 4 Hatch 2 Base Hydra__**

This build from **Hawk** allows you to limit your exposure to early zealot harassment through the use of a sunken and then transition into standard 3 base hydra/lurker play.

```
9 - overlord
9 - pool
10th drone scouts
11th drone makes hatchery at natural
@100% pool
  - make 4 lings
  - if you scout gate expand add 2 lings
  - if you scout forge expand continue making drones
  - if you scout 2 gate, read Hawk's guide on defending 2 gate
14/15 - 3rd hatch at natural (sim city position)

The build order differs going forward based on gate expand or forge expand as you need to
optimize for different things (gate - they have more zealots, forge - they have faster tech)
