# 4h early gas

This build aims to play an economic no spire 5 hatch hydra opening vs stargate opening in the style of 5 hatch before gas, while having fast enough lair tech to be safe against being countered by sairless speedlot openings.
It also provides for the requirement of early zergling speed against gate FE.

The '4h early gas' version of the opening is an optimized version with faster tech and a tight early econ, suitable for players at or near B rank.
The '4h before gas' version has later tech and a more forgiving early econ, more suitable for other beginners.

Both versions converge to having the same midgame opening choices.

Against stargate openings you play an economic 5 hatch hydra and play a normal 4 base hive game.

Against sairless speedlot openings with a normal follow up you play no hydra 3 base hive, turtling with lurkers and sunks, straight to upgraded cracklings and defilers.

Against sairless speedlot openings with a 2 stargate followup, after holding the initial zealot timing you revert to playing hydralisks and a normal 4 base hive game.

vs sairless a lurker open is a beginner friendly way of playing 3 base hive turtle.

vs sairless a muta open is a way of playing muta + 3 base hive turtle in the same way that 3h spire does. After holding the initial zealot timing with sunkens and zerglings, it converges to the same game state as 3h spire would have. 3h spire properly played vs sairless is very strong and has a very high expected winrate for zerg. 3h spire vs sairless is the reason why stargate opening for protoss is standard and preferred, unless the protoss scouts zerg doing a late tech build without the option of opening spire.

 - 3:30 gas
 - 3:45 4th hatch
- vs gate FE
 - 3:00 gas
 - Zergling Speed
 - Pull all drones off gas
 - 4th hatch
 - Put 3 back on gas shortly after 4th hatch start

check for sairless (@ 4 mins vs forge FE)
+1 weapons on forge starting at 3:50-4:15 + no nat gas indicates sairless.
stargate opening doesn't start +1 until 4:45 and should have nat gas completed or building when you scout.
