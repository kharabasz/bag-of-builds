This build progression slightly delays tech in favor of drones while still staying safe and allowing for a transition into 3 base hive.

```
- vs forge FE
 - (overpool)
 - 3:30 gas
 - 3:45 4th hatch
- vs gate FE
 - 3:00 gas

check for sairless (@ 4 mins vs forge FE)
+1 weapons on forge starting at 3:50-4:15 + no nat gas indicates sairless.
stargate opening doesn't start +1 until 4:45 and should have nat gas completed or building when you scout.

 - Evo
 - Nat gas
 - Goal:
   - ~38 drones. 1 per patch on minerals, then add 2-3 drones to each mineral line
