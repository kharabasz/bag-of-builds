# ZvP Fake Speedling 2h Hydra Bust
```
9 pool
9 overlord
first 2 overlords should end up in front of protoss natural
1st overlord goes into protoss base when 2nd overlord arrives
9 gas
9 3x lings
12 3 drones on gas as they finish returning minerals
kill scouting probe
12 1x lings
when scouting probe dies pull 2 drones from gas
take 6 lings and press protoss wall - don't lose any
leave 2 lings on ramp to block scouting
14 hatchery at natural
replacement drone build hydra den
@150 gas - take last drone off of gas
next 3 drones that comes out go to gas
@100% hydra den - hydra speed
16 overlord
make a wall with lings in front of natural to deny scouting
make non-stop hydra and hide them in natural or above your ramp
@100% hydra speed - hydra range
23 or 24 overlord
split lings up and scout around entrance to see if there is a probe, try to clear
at 26/26:
- move army to protoss natural
- re-rally hatches to natural
- move overlord from protoss base to in-front of natural, protect your 2 overlords as sair/dt is an option for toss to stop the break
- attack by using lings to soak cannons and zealots, hydras to focus cannons
- if toss has 2 cannons finished, you want to engage
- if toss has more cannons finished, try to pick off gate or forge while waiting for more hydra to reinfore, hide reinforcements
- once you feel you can break the cannons, split hydra to 2-3 hotkeys and focus down individual cannons
