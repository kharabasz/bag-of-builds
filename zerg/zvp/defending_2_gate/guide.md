**__Hawk on defending 2 gate (ZvP)__**

Vs 2 gate, you have to force situations using the threat of counterattacks. It's difficult to explain because it's a giant flowchart:
- Z takes center of map with lings
- if P sends all zealots, Z counterattacks with center lings, and makes sunken at home
- if P sends some zealots and leaves some zealots, then Z confirms zealots left for defense, then eventually cleans up the partial force at home
- if P leaves all zealots, Z drones.

In none of those scenarios are you fighting with all of your lings vs all of their zealots. That should never happen.

so much seems to change how to respond to it, is it 2g at home or proxy, did you 11h or overpool, are they continuing zlot production or setting up to expand, etc.
And I like to try to pick off the first probe and zlot before the second wave arrives, but that will never work against a good protoss player. Works sometimes vs 1700's and below

For the flowchart to work, you do need to take the map with lings. If you sit your lings at your nat, not much you can do, P can force a fight with all zealots vs all lings, which is very bad for Z. It feels weird to run past 3 zealots coming to your base with your initial 6 lings, but it's the correct choice because that forces zealots 4 & 5 to sit at home or if they don't sit, 6 lings kill P. If they do sit, Z runs back with those 6 lings (faster units), and join together with more lings at home to clean up those 3 zealots they previously bypassed. Part of the flowchart is the assumption that drones + lings hugely outtrade zealots.

Treat a blocked ramp as P sitting. Eat the zealots on the map in that case. 

If 2 zeals pop just as you get there, consider that as P sitting. Go home and eat zealots. Lings are faster, so those two zealots that popped won't be there for the fight.

If I go the mutas route vs a 2gate, does that require 2 gasses?  I feel like Protoss might see the 2nd gas and get anti-air.  Is it normally done on 1 gas?

As a follow up you eventually go 2 gas. If you go muta you need to abuse Protoss's 1 gas which requires that you get sair kills with scourge, and are able to micro muta vs archon. 

Otherwise, Z gives up too much eco going for spire vs 2 gate and the simpler alternative play is to go lurker/drone.
