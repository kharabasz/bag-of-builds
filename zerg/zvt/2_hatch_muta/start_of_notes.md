Pseudo 2 Hatch Guide vs Bio:
----------------------------

There are 2 main build paths for 2 Hatch when facing bio, either "3rd Hatch at 3rd Base" or "3rd Hatch in Base".


When do you go for "3rd Hatch in Base"?

The first reason is when you are cross spawn on a 4 player map and the terran opens 2 rax academy. This is a pressure build and opening "3rd Hatch at 3rd Base" would put your 3rd base in close positions to the terran making it easy for him to kill or force a cancel with an early push. Also when you are cross spawn is the terran will rarely try marine pressure cross positions. Holding marine pressure when skipping ling speed is quite hard and you skip ling speed in "3rd Hatch in Base" to get 7 muta out immediately.

The second reason is less strict and a personal preference. When you are close positions and the terran opens 15 cc (cc starts at or before 2:30 so before a 2nd depot). In this case you want to make 6 lings to force a bunker and getting speed on top of this isn't the best choice.


How do you scout the terran's build?

Early game scouting is important to determine the terran's likely build. Your 1st overlord and 12th drone should be used to scout the map. You are looking for marine count, gas, and cc timing.

If you see a cc started by 2:30 - it is 15cc before 2nd depot. Make 6 lings when pool pops to force a bunker.

If you get into the terran's main before a marine is out and see a gas, the terran is likely opening mech. Refer to the "2 Hatch Guide vs Mech".

If your drone or overlord don't spot a cc and your drone is pushed back by forward marines you should make 4 lings after your pool finishes and use 2 of your first 4 lings to finish scouting that a cc was made.

If a cc was not made by ~2:45 there is a large chance you are playing vs a non-meta build like mech or "1 base 2 rax".

If you see a cc by 3:30 then the terran likely opened factory cc and will follow up with a vulture. You will need to get a creep started by 3:30 at your nat to push back the vulture.

If you don't see a cc and the marine count is low or the terran has walled  above their ramp there is a chance they will open an aggressive mech opening like 2 port wraith, vulture drop, or something like 3 factory goliath. Refer to the "2 Hatch Guide vs Mech".

If the marine count is high and there is no cc, it is likely a 1 Base bio build, potentially with tanks. You should stay on 2 base, add sunkens as needed, and lean heavily into muta to stop 1 base builds. Keep tabs on the marine count, there are 1 base builds like 4 rax aimed at busting with stim right as muta pop. You will need many sunkens.


How do I determine if the terran opened "2 rax academy"?

If you went speed, you can use your lings to poke into the terran's natural at around 4:50-5:00 and check the marine count and check for a bunker.

If you did not go speed, use just one ling as you need to be mindful of reacting to early marine pressure.

If at around 4:50-5:00 terran has a bunker +a small number of marines it is likely 1 rax ebay and you can play without a sunken and make overlords on 25/26 and then muta.

If around 4:50-5:00 terran is ready to move out (8-10 marines, 2 medics) it is likely 2 rax acad. Make an extra overlord on 23/24 and add a sunken +6 lings. You need 1 sunken and 12 lings to hold.

Vs: 1rax ebay
-------------
3rd hatch at 3rd base before 2nd overlords
go for den + queen's nest by 8:00



Vs: 2rax acad
-------------
3rd hatch in base, best if before spire
go for den + chamber at 7:40-7:50, queen's nest after +1 carapace and lurkers are started
