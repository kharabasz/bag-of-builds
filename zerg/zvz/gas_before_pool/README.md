# ZvZ Gas before Pool
```
NOTE: This is a pocket build for players confident in their muta micro. Has a muta advantage timing vs 9 pool lair. 
9 overlord
9 gas
11 spawning pool
drone to 12
@100% spawning pool - lair
-----------------------------------
NOTE: This is a defensive build - you need to react to the opponent's build. If you don't scout their opening you will need to make non-stop lings and possibly 1-3 sunkens if they go into heavy lings.
If they skimp on lings you can add drones and be greedy.
See the example replays focusing on WhistleR.
-----------------------------------
Optimal continuation if you are not pressured:
@100% spawning pool - 4-6 lings
14-15 hatchery
@100% lair - spire
17 2x overlords
start saving larvae
@100% spire - 6 muta
make non-stop muta
If opponent made spores - expo, hunt down his overlords, try to pick off drones once you have 8+ muta.
If opponent did not make spores - attack
```
